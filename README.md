Overview

Tapp aims to be an easy-to-use platform that connects users with on-demand services. The core idea is to offer a user-friendly interface, scalable backend, and modern design principles.

We are integrating dynamic features such as:

Real-time data synchronization,
Secure user authentication,
Cloud-based microservices architecture,
Clean, consistent UI elements derived from our Figma designs.
Features

User Registration & Profile: Sign up, manage personal details, set preferences.
Service Discovery: Browse and book local services via an intuitive interface.
Push Notifications: Real-time updates on service requests, confirmations, and more.
Analytics: Track usage statistics to improve user experience.
Tech Stack

Front-End: React Native (for mobile), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for a possible web version).
Back-End: Node.js with Express or NestJS (sample).
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (depending on your preference).
Deployment: Docker containers, CI/CD on GitHub Actions (optional).
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)
npm or yarn (for dependency management)
(Optional) Docker if you want containerized deployment
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Tapp.git
cd Tapp

npm run dev
or
yarn dev
Open your browser (or simulator, if using mobile) and navigate to the server address (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
Figma Designs

We maintain up-to-date design mockups and prototypes in Figma. This helps keep our development efforts aligned with the product’s UI/UX goals.

Simple Link
You can directly view the designs here:

Note: Make sure you have the appropriate permissions in Figma. If you can’t access the file, request access from the project owners.
Optional Embed with GitHub Pages
GitHub’s default Markdown does not allow iframes in a standard README, but you can embed a Figma prototype if you’re using GitHub Pages (or any static site generator) by creating an HTML file that references your Figma link. For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Tapp Design</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Embedded Figma Prototype</h1>
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=github&url=https://www.figma.com/files/team/1470929359203725284/project/337897994/Tapp?fuid=1470929357203924999"
    allowfullscreen
  >
  </iframe>
</body>
</html>
If you place this file in your docs/ folder (or a gh-pages branch) and enable GitHub Pages, you’ll have an interactive Figma view in your browser.
