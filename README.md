If you encounter any access restrictions, please request permission from the design team.
Embed in GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to embed the Figma prototype on a website or documentation portal (such as GitHub Pages), use an iframe. For example, create index.html in your docs/ folder with the following snippet:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Tapp Design</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Embedded Figma Prototype</h1>
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=github&url=https://www.figma.com/files/team/1470929359203725284/project/337897994/Tapp?fuid=1470929357203924999"
    allowfullscreen
  >
  </iframe>
</body>
</html>
Then enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings to serve this page. (Note: Markdown files on GitHub do not support iframes, so you can’t embed directly in a README.)
